# Online-shopping-system

## Project Purpose:
An online shopping system is a procedure that allows individuals, more specifically 
consumers, to buy products and services directly from the vendor in a real-time 
setting. Online shopping is a kind of electronic commerce on the internet. From a 
commercial standpoint, clients typically find the items more appealing on websites 
since they can get all the information there.

## Project Description:
Customers may browse the website and place orders whenever they want thanks to 
our customised online shopping system, which offers a 24-7 service. Additionally, the 
delivery system is operational 24/7. Future modifications and additions to this system 
might include its adoption by neighbourhood store owners, who would then provide 
customers an online interface for ordering and shopping.
